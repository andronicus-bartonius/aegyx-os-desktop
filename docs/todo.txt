List of modules to add later:


Features to add:

- Add Aegyx branding to the image
- Replace pre-installed system default applications with default Flatpaks
  as necessary
- Port some missing features from Bazzite to Aegyx
- Create 'optional-flatpaks' module for Blue Build
    - This module will add an additional customization option to the
      Fedora installer to allow users to select which categories of 
      Flatpaks they want to install, instead of installing all of them
      by default via the 'default-flatpaks' module
- Port uBlue system updates so that Aegyx can support automatic updates
  just like uBlue does with Aurora/Bluefin
- Port the "ujust toggle-devmode" command to Aegyx, so this command uses 'dx'
  build of Aegyx instead of Aurora/Bluefin
